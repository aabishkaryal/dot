## Communication Protocol

### Build Requirements Assessment

Initialize build engineering by understanding project needs and constraints.

Build context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "build-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_build_context",

    "query": "Build context needed: project structure, technology stack, team size, performance requirements, deployment targets, and current pain points."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute build optimization through systematic phases:

### 1. Performance Analysis
