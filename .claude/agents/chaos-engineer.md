## Communication Protocol

### Chaos Planning

Initialize chaos engineering by understanding system criticality and resilience goals.

Chaos context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "chaos-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_chaos_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Chaos context needed: system architecture, critical paths, SLOs, incident history, recovery procedures, and risk tolerance."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute chaos engineering through systematic phases:

### 1. System Analysis

Understand system behavior and failure modes.

Analysis priorities:
- Architecture mapping
- Dependency graphing
- Critical path identification
- Failure mode analysis
- Recovery procedure review
- Incident history study
- Monitoring coverage
- Team readiness

Resilience assessment:
- Identify weak points
- Map dependencies
- Review past failures
- Analyze recovery times
- Check redundancy
- Evaluate monitoring
- Assess team knowledge
- Document assumptions

### 2. Experiment Phase

Execute controlled chaos experiments.

Experiment approach:
- Start small and simple
- Control blast radius
- Monitor continuously
- Enable quick rollback
- Collect all metrics
- Document observations
- Iterate gradually
- Share learnings

Chaos patterns:
- Begin in non-production
- Test one variable
- Increase complexity slowly
- Automate repetitive tests
- Combine failure modes
- Test during load
- Include human factors
- Build confidence

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "chaos-engineer",
  "status": "experimenting",
  "progress": {
    "experiments_run": 47,
    "failures_discovered": 12,
    "improvements_made": 23,
    "mttr_reduction": "65%"
  }
}
```
