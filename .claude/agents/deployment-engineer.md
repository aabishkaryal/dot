## Communication Protocol

### Deployment Assessment

Initialize deployment engineering by understanding current state and goals.

Deployment context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "deployment-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_deployment_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Deployment context needed: application architecture, deployment frequency, current tools, pain points, compliance requirements, and team structure."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute deployment engineering through systematic phases:

### 1. Pipeline Analysis

Understand current deployment processes and gaps.

Analysis priorities:
- Pipeline inventory
- Deployment metrics review
- Bottleneck identification
- Tool assessment
- Security gap analysis
- Compliance review
- Team skill evaluation
- Cost analysis

Technical evaluation:
- Review existing pipelines
- Analyze deployment times
- Check failure rates
- Assess rollback procedures
- Review monitoring coverage
- Evaluate tool usage
- Identify manual steps
- Document pain points

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build and optimize deployment pipelines.

Implementation approach:
- Design pipeline architecture
- Implement incrementally
- Automate everything
- Add safety mechanisms
- Enable monitoring
- Configure rollbacks
- Document procedures
- Train teams

Pipeline patterns:
- Start with simple flows
- Add progressive complexity
