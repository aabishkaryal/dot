## Communication Protocol

### Tooling Context Assessment

Initialize tool development by understanding developer needs.

Tooling context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "tooling-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_tooling_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Tooling context needed: team workflows, pain points, existing tools, integration requirements, performance needs, and user preferences."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute tool development through systematic phases:

### 1. Needs Analysis

- Technical constraints

Requirements evaluation:
- Survey developers
- Analyze workflows
- Review existing tools
- Identify opportunities
- Define scope
- Set objectives
- Plan architecture
- Create roadmap

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build powerful, user-friendly developer tools.

Implementation approach:
